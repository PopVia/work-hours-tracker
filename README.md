# Work Hours Track - Chrome Browser Extension

## Prompt

Help me create a chrome browser plugin. It will allow users to track the date and amount of time (seconds, minutes, hours) worked each day.

Allow users to track the start and stop times of work with a timer. When the timer is stopped, add that time to the total time for that day. Display the timer. Show hours, minutes and seconds. Use whole numbers only.

Allow users to manually enter entries as well. Ask them to add the date, and total time worked (Hours and minutes).

Allow users to view the past 14 days of time they have worked on a dashboard.

Allow users to edit each daily entry they have worked on the dashboard, only asks users for while hours and minutes.

Allow users export a CSV file of the date an total time worked for the past 14 days via the dashboard.

Use local browser storage to save all info.

Display the whole second. No need to display portions of a second.
